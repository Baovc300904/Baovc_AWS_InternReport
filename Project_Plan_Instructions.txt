1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Devteria Game Store is a scalable cloud-based e-commerce platform for digital game licensing and distribution. Built entirely on AWS infrastructure, it delivers secure user authentication, real-time inventory management, automated order processing, and global content delivery.

The platform addresses critical challenges faced by traditional digital stores:
• Traffic spike handling during sales events
• Complex authentication processes reducing conversions
• Manual inventory management causing overselling
• Lack of real-time analytics and insights
• High infrastructure costs for peak capacity planning

Devteria leverages AWS services including:
• CloudFront + S3 for fast global content delivery
• Cognito for secure authentication with MFA
• API Gateway + Lambda for serverless backend logic
• RDS PostgreSQL + S3 for reliable data storage
• SQS + SNS for asynchronous order processing
• CodePipeline for continuous deployment

The solution supports thousands of concurrent users with 99.9% uptime guarantee and achieves cost efficiency through serverless architecture that scales automatically based on demand.

1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA

• Achieve page load time of less than 2 seconds globally through CloudFront CDN
• Maintain 99.9% system uptime using AWS managed services and Multi-AZ deployment
• Handle 10x traffic spikes automatically through Lambda auto-scaling and EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
• Ensure zero security breaches with Cognito MFA, IAM policies, and encryption at rest/transit
• Complete CI/CD pipeline enabling deployments in less than 10 minutes via CodePipeline
• Reduce cart abandonment by 40% through simplified Cognito authentication flow
• Decrease infrastructure management time by 60% using serverless components
• Maintain stable performance for 10,000 monthly active users with room to scale to 100K+
• Ensure database consistency with RDS automated backups and point-in-time recovery (7-day retention)
• Achieve PCI-ready security posture for payment processing integration

1.3 ASSUMPTIONS

• The customer will provide accurate business requirements and game licensing workflows
• GitLab repository and credentials will be accessible for CI/CD integration
• All workloads will operate within one AWS Region (us-east-1 or ap-southeast-1)
• No on-premise system integration required during the initial phase
• Frontend code (React/Next.js) supports static hosting via S3 + CloudFront
• The project will not include Machine Learning or AI recommendation modules in Phase 1
• Traffic is expected to remain within reasonable limits (10,000 users initially)
• Payment gateway integration will use third-party APIs (Stripe/PayPal) via Lambda
• Game files will be uploaded manually or via admin dashboard to S3
• Customer accepts AWS Free Tier limitations and cost estimates provided

2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM

2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

The Devteria Game Store architecture consists of the following layers:

1. Edge Networking Layer
   • Route 53: DNS management and domain hosting
   • CloudFront: Global CDN for caching static assets and reducing latency (<2s page load)
   • AWS Shield: DDoS protection (Standard tier included)

2. Application Layer
   • Frontend: React/Next.js app hosted on S3 + CloudFront
   • API Gateway: RESTful API entry point with request validation and throttling
   • Lambda Functions: Serverless backend logic (authentication, catalog browsing, order processing)
   • EC2 Auto Scaling Group: Microservices for complex business logic (2x t3.medium instances)
   • Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic to EC2 instances

3. Data Layer
   • RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ: User accounts, game catalog, orders, license keys
   • S3 Buckets: Game installation files, promotional assets, static website hosting
   • SQS: Message queue for asynchronous order processing and license generation
   • SNS: Email notifications for order confirmations and promotions

4. Networking Layer
   • VPC: Isolated network environment (10.0.0.0/16)
   • Public Subnets: ALB, NAT Gateway for internet access
   • Private Subnets: EC2 instances, RDS database (no direct internet exposure)
   • Internet Gateway: External access for public-facing resources

5. CI/CD Layer
   • GitLab: Source code repository with version control
   • CodePipeline: Orchestrates automated build and deployment workflow
   • CodeBuild: Compiles code, runs tests, creates deployment artifacts
   • EC2 Deployment: Automated deployment to instances via CodeDeploy

6. Security & Monitoring Layer
   • Cognito: User authentication and authorization with MFA support
   • IAM: Fine-grained access control with least privilege policies
   • Secrets Manager: Secure storage for database credentials with automatic rotation
   • CloudWatch: Metrics collection, logs aggregation, and alarms
   • CloudTrail: API audit logging for compliance

User Flow:
User accesses site → Login via Cognito → Browse games (API Gateway → Lambda → RDS) → Add to cart → Checkout → Payment processing → License generation (SQS) → Email notification (SNS) → Secure download from S3

2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN

The partner will implement the architecture using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via AWS CloudFormation to ensure consistent, reproducible, and version-controlled deployments.

CI/CD Pipeline Stages:
• Source: GitLab webhook triggers CodePipeline on commit
• Build: CodeBuild compiles React frontend and Node.js backend
• Test: Automated unit tests, integration tests, and security scans
• Deploy: Frontend to S3, Backend to EC2 via CodeDeploy with blue/green deployment

Additional Technical Configurations:
• IAM roles restricted following least-privilege model (separate roles for Lambda, EC2, RDS access)
• RDS automated backups with 7-day retention and point-in-time recovery
• CloudWatch alarms for CPU >80%, memory >85%, database connections >80%, API 5xx errors
• S3 versioning enabled for rollback capability
• Cognito user pool with strong password policies (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
• Lambda provisioned concurrency to eliminate cold starts during peak hours

Test Cases (to be documented in Appendix):
• Authentication flows (signup, login, MFA, password reset)
• API integration (catalog retrieval, order creation, payment processing)
• Database failover testing (RDS Multi-AZ automatic failover)
• Load testing scenarios (1000 concurrent users, 10x traffic spike)
