- Introduction to AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- Overview of security landscape in cloud computing
- Discussion of common security challenges

**2:15 – 3:30 PM | AWS Security Services**

**AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- IAM best practices and policies
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- IAM roles and service accounts
- Permission boundaries and SCPs

**AWS Security Monitoring**
- Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection
- AWS Security Hub for centralized security view
- AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- Amazon Macie for data discovery and protection

**Network Security**
- VPC security best practices
- Security Groups and Network ACLs
- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection

**3:30 – 3:45 PM | Break**
- Q&A session and networking

**3:45 – 5:00 PM | Compliance & Data Protection**

**AWS Encryption Services**

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- AWS Certificate Manager
- AWS Secrets Manager

**Compliance Frameworks**
- AWS compliance programs overview
- AWS Artifact for compliance reports
- GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS considerations
- Compliance automation with AWS Config

**Hands-on Lab: Securing a Web Application**
- Setting up security monitoring with GuardDuty
- Implementing encryption with KMS
- Configuring WAF rules
- Testing security controls

### Key Highlights

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls
- **Automated Monitoring:** GuardDuty and Security Hub provide continuous threat detection
- **Encryption Everywhere:** Easy implementation of encryption using AWS services
- **Compliance Made Easier:** AWS services help meet compliance requirements
- **Audit Trail:** CloudTrail provides complete activity logging

### Key Learnings

- Understanding the AWS Shared Responsibility Model is fundamental
- IAM policies should follow principle of least privilege
- Encryption should be enabled by default for sensitive data
- Security monitoring must be continuous, not periodic
- Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and customers
- Security automation reduces human error

### Application to Internship

**Immediate Applications:**
- Review and improve IAM policies in practice projects
- Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
- Implement encryption for S3 buckets and RDS databases
- Set up CloudTrail for audit logging

**Security Best Practices:**
- Always use MFA for privileged accounts
- Regularly rotate access keys and credentials
- Implement least privilege access control
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Monitor security events continuously

**Compliance Considerations:**
- Understand which compliance frameworks apply
- Use AWS Config for compliance automation
- Document security controls and processes
- Regular security audits and reviews
