# Summary Report: "AWS Well-Architected Framework Workshop"

**Date & Time:** Saturday, November 29, 2025, 8:30 AM – 12:00 PM  
**Location:** FCJ Learning Center, Ho Chi Minh City  
**Role:** Workshop Participant  
**Organizer:** First Cloud Journey, AWS User Group Vietnam

### Event Purpose

This workshop provided comprehensive overview of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, focusing on the five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization. The session helped participants understand how to design and evaluate cloud architectures using AWS best practices.

### Agenda Overview

- Tagging strategies
- S3 storage class optimization

**11:45 – 12:00 PM | Wrap-up & Q&A**
- Summary of key takeaways
- Well-Architected Tool demonstration
- Resources for further learning
- Certificate distribution

### Key Highlights

- **Holistic Approach:** Framework covers all aspects of cloud architecture
- **Best Practices:** Based on AWS experience with thousands of customers
- **Trade-offs:** Understanding when to prioritize one pillar over another
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular reviews and updates are essential
- **Well-Architected Tool:** Free tool to evaluate your architectures

### Key Learnings

**Framework Application:**
- The five pillars are interconnected and should be considered together
- Trade-offs are inevitable - understanding them is key
- Regular architecture reviews help identify improvement opportunities
- The framework applies to workloads of all sizes

**Operational Excellence:**
- Automation reduces human error and increases efficiency
- Learning from failures improves operations over time
- Documentation and runbooks are crucial

**Security:**
- Security should be built into every layer
- Principle of least privilege for access control
- Continuous monitoring is essential

**Reliability:**
- Design for failure and nothing fails
- Testing recovery procedures is as important as having them
- Distribute workloads across multiple availability zones

**Performance Efficiency:**
- Monitor and measure to understand performance
- Choose the right service for the workload
- Serverless can simplify architecture

**Cost Optimization:**
- Measure and analyze spending regularly
- Use the right resources for the job
- Take advantage of AWS pricing models

### Application to Internship

**Immediate Applications:**
- Review existing projects using Well-Architected principles
- Implement IaC for infrastructure deployment
- Set up cost monitoring and budgets
- Improve security posture with IAM best practices

**Architecture Design:**
- Apply the framework when designing new solutions
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Consider all five pillars in design discussions
- Use the Well-Architected Tool for self-assessment

**Best Practices:**
- Implement infrastructure as code
- Enable comprehensive monitoring
- Set up automated backups
- Apply proper tagging for cost allocation
