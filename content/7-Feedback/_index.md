### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The learning environment at FCJ is well-structured with clear weekly objectives and comprehensive learning materials. The online documentation and workshop content are detailed and easy to follow. I appreciate the flexibility to learn at my own pace while still having a roadmap to follow. One suggestion would be to add more interactive elements like live Q&A sessions or study groups where interns can discuss challenges together.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors are knowledgeable and responsive when I have questions about AWS services or architecture decisions. They provide helpful resources and point me in the right direction rather than just giving answers, which encourages independent learning. The admin team is organized in managing documents and communication channels. However, sometimes response time can be slower during peak periods, which is understandable.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The AWS cloud computing content is highly relevant to my IT/Computer Science background. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge from university and practical industry skills. Learning services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and VPC directly applies to what I studied about networking, databases, and distributed systems. The serverless architecture concepts were particularly new and valuable.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
This internship significantly improved my technical skills in cloud infrastructure, not just AWS-specific knowledge but also broader concepts like high availability, disaster recovery, and cost optimization. I also developed soft skills like technical writing (for reports), time management (weekly tasks), and self-directed learning. The hands-on workshops were especially effective for skill building.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
FCJ promotes a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. The emphasis on AWS Journey content and community-driven learning creates a supportive atmosphere. While most interaction is remote/online, the community channels make it easy to connect with other learners and share experiences. The open-source nature of the learning materials reflects a collaborative spirit.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The program structure is clear with defined weekly goals and milestones. The access to comprehensive AWS learning resources and workshop materials is valuable. The flexibility to complete tasks on your own schedule while meeting weekly deadlines is practical for students balancing other commitments. Having documentation in both English and Vietnamese is also helpful.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
The hands-on experience building actual AWS infrastructure was most satisfying. Moving from just reading about services to actually deploying VPCs, configuring Lambda functions, and setting up databases gave me real confidence. Completing the final project that integrated multiple AWS services felt like a genuine achievement.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
- Add more troubleshooting scenarios and "debugging labs" where interns practice fixing broken configurations
- Provide sample interview questions or certification preparation materials to help interns transition to jobs or AWS certifications
- Create a peer review system where interns can review each other's architecture designs
- Offer optional advanced tracks for those who finish early or want deeper specialization

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Yes, I would definitely recommend FCJ to friends interested in cloud computing. The structured learning path, quality materials, and practical experience make it an excellent starting point for AWS. It's especially good for self-motivated learners who want flexibility. However, I'd note that it requires discipline since much of the learning is self-paced.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
- Add monthly "architecture review" sessions where interns present their solutions and get feedback
- Create a Discord or Slack channel for real-time discussions among current interns
- Provide cost tracking templates to help interns monitor their AWS spending during practice
- Include more case studies from real companies showing how they use AWS services
- Offer optional capstone project ideas for different interests (data analytics, web apps, IoT, etc.)

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
I would be interested in an advanced program focused on specialized areas like AWS security (GuardDuty, Security Hub), data engineering (EMR, Redshift), or DevOps practices (ECS, EKS, CI/CD pipelines). A mentorship program where experienced alumni guide new interns would also be valuable.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**  
Overall, this internship exceeded my expectations. I came in with basic AWS knowledge and left with practical skills I can immediately apply. The progression from fundamental services (EC2, S3) to advanced topics (serverless, containers, data analytics) was well-paced. The emphasis on documentation and reporting also taught me the importance of explaining technical decisions clearly - a skill often overlooked in technical training.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn in a structured yet flexible environment. The experience has motivated me to pursue AWS certifications and consider cloud engineering as a career path. Thank you to the FCJ team for creating and maintaining such valuable learning resources.
